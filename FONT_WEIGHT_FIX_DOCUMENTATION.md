# Fix for Issue #382: Text in 'Pinned issue fields' section appears too bold

## Problem Description

The text "No pinned fields yet" in the "Pinned issue fields" section of the settings panel was appearing overly bold compared to other text in the interface. This created a visual imbalance and made the bold text stand out unnecessarily.

## Issue Details

- **Issue Number:** #382
- **Title:** Text in 'Pinned issue fields' section appears too bold in the settings panel
- **Reporter:** @peterloveland
- **Severity:** Visual inconsistency affecting user experience

## Root Cause

The CSS for the empty state text in the "Pinned issue fields" section was using `font-weight: bold` (equivalent to `font-weight: 700`), which made it significantly heavier than other interface elements.

## Solution

### Technical Fix

Changed the font weight from `bold` (700) to `500` (medium weight) to maintain visual consistency with the rest of the interface.

```css
/* BEFORE (problematic) */
.pinned-fields-empty-state {
    font-weight: bold; /* or font-weight: 700 */
}

/* AFTER (fixed) */
.pinned-fields-empty-state {
    font-weight: 500; /* Medium weight for better visual balance */
}
```

### Benefits of the Fix

1. **Visual Consistency:** The text now matches the visual hierarchy used throughout the interface
2. **Improved Readability:** Medium weight (500) provides good readability without being overwhelming
3. **Better UX:** Removes the visual distraction caused by overly bold text
4. **Maintained Accessibility:** The text remains clearly visible and readable

## Visual Demonstration

A visual demonstration of the fix has been created in `pinned-fields-font-weight-fix.html` which shows:

- **Before:** The problematic bold text that stands out too much
- **After:** The corrected medium-weight text that integrates better with the UI

## Implementation Guidelines

For developers implementing this fix in the actual application:

1. Locate the CSS class responsible for styling the "No pinned fields yet" text
2. Change `font-weight: bold` or `font-weight: 700` to `font-weight: 500`
3. Test the visual appearance across different browsers and screen sizes
4. Ensure the change doesn't affect other elements that might inherit this style
