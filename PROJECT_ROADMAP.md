├── __init__.py
├── core/
├── utils/
└── main.py
```

### Game Development (Phaser.js)
```bash
# Phase 1 Setup
npm init -y
npm install phaser
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server

```

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Scope Creep**: Define clear MVP boundaries
2. **Technology Choice**: Research thoroughly before committing
3. **Community Building**: Start early, engage consistently
4. **Performance**: Plan for scalability from the beginning

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Start small and iterate
- Document all architectural decisions
- Set up monitoring and feedback loops
- Regular code reviews and testing

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria:
- [ ] Project builds without errors
- [ ] Basic tests pass
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Phase 2 Success Criteria:
- [ ] MVP functional
- [ ] Test coverage >70%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan passes

### Phase 3 Success Criteria:
- [ ] Production-ready
- [ ] Test coverage >80%
- [ ] All documentation complete
- [ ] Community guidelines established

### Long-term Success Metrics:
- Active community participation
- Regular contributions from external developers
- Positive user feedback and adoption
- Stable, reliable software releases

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team:
- **Minimum**: 1 full-stack developer
- **Recommended**: 2-3 developers (frontend, backend, DevOps)
- **Optimal**: 4-5 person team with defined roles

### Tools and Services:
- GitHub (version control and CI/CD)
- Development environment setup
- Testing and monitoring tools
- Deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, AWS)

### Time Investment:
